/*What is the last value alerted by this code? Why?

let i = 3;

while (i) {
  alert( i-- );
}
(1)

For every loop iteration, write down which value it outputs and then compare it with the solution.

Both loops alert the same values, or not?

The prefix form ++i:

let i = 0;
while (++i < 5) alert( i );
(4)
The postfix form i++

let i = 0;
while (i++ < 5) alert( i );
(5)

For each loop write down which values it is going to show. Then compare with the answer.

Both loops alert same values or not?

The postfix form:

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) alert( i );
The prefix form:

for (let i = 0; i < 5; ++i) alert( i );
(van a devolver los mismos valores)
